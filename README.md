# Movie-Recommender-System
The movie recommender system is a content-based recommender system to which if a movie's title is given, it makes five recommendations for additional films based on the content and tags. The movie dataset is extracted from the TMDB dataset, which is preprocessed and vectorized before being fed into the model. To provide a user-friendly interface, streamlit is utilised in the frontend.
